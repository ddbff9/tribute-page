He is a three-time champion of motocross racing and has won gold medals at the X Games in a variety of disciplines. He has competed in NASCAR events and currently participates in its Camping World Truck Series. With his Puerto Rican heritage on his father's side, Pastrana has been able to represent Puerto Rico when competing internationally. He also ran his own TV sports show, Nitro Circus, in 2009, which branched out into a tour and feature film. In 2018, he landed three motorcycle jumps previously attempted by famed daredevil Evel Knievel as part of History's Evel Live event in Las Vegas.</p>

<h3>Career Highlights</h3>

<h5>Motocross/Supercross</h5>

<p>Pastrana is a three-time motocross racing champion. In 2000 he won the AMA 125cc National championship and the following year he doubled up on his victories, winning the 125cc East Coast Supercross Championship, as well the 125cc Rose Creek Invitational. 
<br>
<br>
In 2002 he was able to compete on the 250cc class level but has yet to win a championship.</p>

<h5>X-Games</h5>

<p>A natural daredevil, Pastrana has competed in the X Games, earning his first gold medal in 1999 and from there, winning 10 more. He's been a champion in four disciplines: Freestyle, Best Trick, Speed & Style and Rally Car Racing. 
<br>
<br>
With his backflips, double backflips and Rodeo 720s (aka the TP7), Pastrana has made history in action sports. In 2006 he was just the third athlete to have won triple golds at one X Games and holds the record for highest score (98 points) under the Best Trick category.
<br>
<br>    
“I always wanted to make a living riding dirt bikes," Pastrana said in an interview in 2016. “I enjoy the racing. I enjoy hating other competitors. I enjoy convincing myself that they beat up my grandma and I'm going to knock them down and I’m going to win the race."
<br>
<br>    
In total he holds 17 medals (11 gold, 4 silver and 2 bronze). Among those medals, 13 are from Moto X, while the remaining 4 are from Rally Car. He is one of the most decorated Moto X athletes in X Games history and was the first athlete to have completed a double backflip on his motorcycle.</p>

<h3>Nascar</h3>

<p>In 2011 Pastrana competed in his first NASCAR event and had a sixth place finish. He continued to compete in various races but wasn't making the kind of competitive headway he had hoped for, finishing 31st at Richmond International Raceway later that year and in 2012 taking 22nd place in his Nationwide Series Debut at the Richmond 250. Pastrana did better when he competed at the Camping World Truck Series with a 15th place finish.
<br>
<br>
In 2013 Pastrana achieved his first pole and had four top-10 finishes but decided to retire at the end of the season. However, he made a comeback starting in 2015, competing in the Truck Series.
 <br>
 <br>
 "NASCAR was the least successful of any venture I’ve gotten into. But I tell you, it was an awesome experience,” Pastrana admitted to USA TODAY Sports in 2017.</p>
